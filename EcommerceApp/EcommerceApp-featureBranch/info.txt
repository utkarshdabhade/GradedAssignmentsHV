E-commerce Application Using DOM



Task 1: Setting Up the Basic Structure
Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating the basic structure of an e-commerce application using JavaScript DOM manipulation. The application will consist of a product list, a shopping cart, and some basic functionality to add and remove products from the cart.

Example : 


Tasks:

Mock Data : https://dummyjson.com/products

Create an HTML file with appropriate containers for the product list and the shopping cart.
Link the HTML file to a JavaScript file where you will perform the DOM manipulation.
Create a JavaScript function to generate and display a list of products. You can use dummy data for now, like product names, prices, and images.
Ensure that each product displayed has an "Add to Cart" button.
Task 2: Adding Products to the Shopping Cart
Problem Statement:
You have successfully set up the basic structure for the e-commerce application. Now, your task is to implement the functionality that allows users to add products to their shopping cart when they click the "Add to Cart" button.

Tasks:

Attach event listeners to the "Add to Cart" buttons so that when clicked, the corresponding product is added to the shopping cart.
Create a JavaScript function to update the shopping cart's visual representation whenever a product is added. You can simply display the product name and price for now.


Task 3: Displaying the Shopping Cart Total
Problem Statement:
As users add products to their shopping cart, you need to display the total price of all the items in the cart. Implement this functionality.

Tasks:

Modify the JavaScript function responsible for updating the shopping cart to also calculate and display the total price.
Update the function to handle quantity adjustments (increasing or decreasing) for each product in the cart.
Task 4: Removing Products from the Shopping Cart
Problem Statement:
Users should be able to remove products from the shopping cart if they change their minds. Implement this feature.

Tasks:

Add a "Remove" button next to each product in the shopping cart.
Implement event listeners for these "Remove" buttons to remove the corresponding product from the cart and update the total price accordingly.
